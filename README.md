# Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Hello! I’m Claire Scanlon, a dedicated data analyst and strategist with a passion for identifying insights from complex data. 

Thank you for visiting the technical side of my portfolio. </br> </br>
 🎚️ For non-technical audiences: each completed project has a blog post that explains the project in simple terms. You can find these blog posts linked alongside the project details. 

### About Me  </br>
I never saw my hearing loss as a limitation and never let it stop me from doing what I wanted to do. I always felt it gave me an unique strength professionally. It took me a while to figure out exactly what it was. A few years ago, it hit me. I was using data and information in everything I did, both professionally and personally. Every strategy, every process, every decision was driven by data. I was combining different data sources and spotting patterns and trends within the data.
</br> 

I also love telling stories with data, empowering others with data-driven information. 
</br>
</br>
My life is all about the power of decisions driven by data. I want to help others see that power too.
</br>
