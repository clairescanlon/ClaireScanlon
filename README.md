# Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Hello! I’m Claire Scanlon, a dedicated data analyst and strategist with a passion for identifying insights from complex data. 

I believe in the power of data to drive positive change and growth. I am committed to empowering others with data. 

Thank you for visiting the technical side of my portfolio. </br> </br>
 🎚️ For non-technical audiences: each completed project has a blog post that explains the project in simple terms. You can find these blog posts linked alongside the project details. 

### About Me  </br>
My pattern recognition abilities were developed navigating through life with a hearing loss. This ability gives me an advantage as it enables me to identify patterns that are commonly overlooked. 

I know the power of information. I want others to know the power as well.
