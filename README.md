# Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm **Claire Scanlon**. 





Thank you for visiting the technical side of my portfolio. </br>
🎚️ For non-technical audiences, completed projects have a blog post detailing the non-technical aspects of the project. Those blog posts are linked in the same row with the project details. 

### About Me  </br>
Growing up with hearing loss, I learned to gather, connect, and analyze information based on the information I had. I was always looking for patterns and filling in gaps to complete my understanding of what was going on.  This valuable skill and mindset drew me to data analysis. I spot connections and patterns between disparate data points that others frequently overlook.

I know the power of information. I want others to know the power as well.
